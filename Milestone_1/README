As showed in the E/R diagram, I translate it to following tables: RegisteredUser, Car, Flight, Volunteer, NewStudent and Pickup. The pickp is the relation between volunteer and new student. Car_plate in volunteer reference the plate_number in Car table since we assume different volunteer may use the same car. Similarly, the flight in NewStudent table references to flight_number in Flight table. For testcase, I insert 2 volunteers and 2 students in the table without violating the constrains and select the student corresponds to some requirements like ** University and so on.
